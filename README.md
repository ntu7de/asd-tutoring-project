# Tutor Me Web Application

Throughout the course of my Spring 2023 semester, I worked with a team of five as the role of DevOps Manager to develop and deploy a web application used to pair tutors with students in need of tutoring in specific classes. The application was built using a Django framework in Python and HTML with Bootstrap on CSS for styling elements. A PostgreSQL Database was created from scratch to store information about both tutors and students in addition to UVA class data imported from a SIS API. Lastly, the web application was deployed and hosted using Heroku. My task as DevOps Manager was to keep track of all the technologies used throughout the project and their purposes, as well as to deploy the site on Heroku.
